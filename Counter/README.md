This program looks at source files in the automatically created 'PRG' folder, and counts
the total number of lines in the source files.

Just a simple program to get started with reading files.

2. Close the program (if open), and place source files in the folder (It won't search subfolders)
3. Run the program, watch it quickly count how many lines of code you've written for your project.
